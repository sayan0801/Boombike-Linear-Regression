## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
Linear Regression performed on the Boombikes bike rental dataset as part of an assignment for coursework in the course Executive PG in Machine Learning and AI from IIIT Bangalore.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Building a model for the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
Dataset that contains the complete data through the time period 2018 t0 2019

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis - The R-squared value of the train set is 82.71% whereas the test set has a value of 81.13% which suggests that our model broadly explains the variance quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis - The p-values and VIF were used to select the significant variables. RFE was also conducted for automated selection of variables.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
